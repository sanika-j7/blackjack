# Blackjack
Welcome to the Blackjack game! Test your luck and skill in this classic card game where the goal is to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible without going over.
# Overview
Blackjack is a popular casino card game where players compete against the dealer. 
Each player and the dealer are dealt two cards, with the player aiming to get a hand total closest to 21 but not greater than 21. 
Face cards are worth 10 points, aces can be worth either 1 or 11 depending upon whether the hand total score has exceeded 21, and numbered cards are worth their face value.
The game starts with the player and dealer each receiving two cards.
The player can choose to hit, stand, or double down.
After the player’s turn, the dealer reveals their hidden card and plays according to house rules.
The player wins if their hand total is closer to 21 than the dealer’s hand without exceeding 21.
The player loses if their hand total exceeds 21.
If both the player and dealer have the same total, the game is a push (tie).
